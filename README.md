# Fast Fibonacci

This is the fastest and most accurate Fibonacci number calculator I could make. It's so good it even works for negative numbers.

> ~~Python~~ Rust laid waste to my C++.

## Directions

Clone the repository.
```sh
git clone
```

Run the release version for best performance.
```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Benchmarks

This can compute between the 10 (old) to 25 (new) millionth Fibonacci number in 1 second on a laptop without loss of accuracy. So it's safe to say that it's faster than [@GSheaf](https://github.com/GSheaf)'s code.
